# Lit Starter with Google Material

This is a super simple starter project using lit-html. 

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve
```

To see it in action. 

The code in the `material` branch uses Material Design 3 lit components from
https://github.com/material-components/material-web. To get this to work
properly, you need to clone this repo in the same directory that `lit-starter`
is cloned to:

```
git clone https://github.com/material-components/material-web
cd material-web
npm run build
cd ../lit-starter
npm install
npm run build
```
